# Venmo_Social_Network_Pyspark
Predicted customers lifetime transaction with social network clustering and text analytics on 7M records in Spark.

# Context 

Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment app owned by PayPal. The Venmo app allows its users to exchange money with just a click of a button. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth, and its user-base had more than 40 million active accounts. 
What made Venmo so popular in the US is its social flavor; users are required to accompany their transactions with a message describing what the transaction was about. This social twist has allowed Venmo to transform financial transactions into sharing experiences. In this project, we are to answer some questions related to text analysis and social network analysis.
